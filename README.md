# renderer-from-scratch

The goal of this project is to create a simple program that can transform vertex data from .obj file to an image using as little to no libraries as possible.

## Libraries Used:
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) because I don't want to handle windows by myself. The only features of SDL2 I am using are window handling and drawing pixels.

# TODO

- Add function to draw triangles
    - Fix pixel gaps
- Draw a model with triangles!
- Implement a Z-buffer
