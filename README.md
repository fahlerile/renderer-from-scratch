# renderer-from-scratch

The goal of this project is to create a simple program that can transform vertex data to an image.

# TODO

- Modify `Image::line` to draw any line
- Read an `.obj` file and render it in wireframe mode (lines only)
- Add function to draw triangles
- Check `Image` class for memory leaks
